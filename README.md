# Graph-Neural-Networks-GNNs-
Graph-Based Learning: In domains where data has inherent relational structure (e.g., medical imaging, social networks), GNNs are used to learn from graph-structured data. In brain tumor segmentation, GNNs can model complex relationships between image pixels or regions and enhance segmentation accuracy by considering spatial dependencies.
